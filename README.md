# <img src="app/pesterchums.png" align="center"> PesterChum 6.0, _version 0.1_

A non-functional recreation of the [PesterChum 6.0][page that shows PesterChum] client from [Homestuck][].

There's actually a functional client [over here](https://github.com/illuminatedwax/pesterchum). 
(It takes some liberties with the UI, naturally.)

## Install + Run

Like I said, this thing isn't functional, but here's the steps:

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the project
* In the project directory, run `npm i` to install
* `npm start`
