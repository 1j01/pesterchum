# <img src="app/pesterchums.png" align="center"> PesterChum 6.0, _version 0.1_

A non-functional recreation of the [MSPA][] [PesterChum][page that shows PesterChum] 6.0 client.

There's actually a functional client [over here](https://github.com/illuminatedwax/pesterchum), but it takes some liberties with the UI.

## Run

There's not much to see here, but if you have Node.js, you can clone the project and run `npm i` and `npm start`
